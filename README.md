# SudokuSolver
An automatic Sudoku Solving experiment in C# and WPF

Allows users to enter Sudoku puzzles on the grid, and solve them almost immediately at the press of a button. This of course **completely defeats the purpose** of doing a Sudoku puzzle, but is purely an exercise in *programming to implement a software algorithm* that can do it.

Users can also **Save** and **Load** puzzles they have entered on the grid.
